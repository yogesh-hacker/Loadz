**LoadZ** is an advanced download manager currently in development. It aims to provide a seamless downloading experience with support for modern media formats and essential download controls.

- **Standard File Downloads**: Easily download regular files from the internet.
- **Pause & Resume**: Interrupt and continue your downloads without data loss.

## Contribution

We welcome developers to contribute and grow this project together. **LoadZ** is being developed using inspiration from:

- [Fetch2](https://github.com/tonyofrancis/Fetch)
- [PRDownloader](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/PRDownloader)

These libraries have served as references for architecture and best practices. However, **LoadZ is built from scratch** and **not a copy-paste implementation**.
